# Gyro Aim Demo for Godot

This is a simple first-person shooter demo game for Godot Engine made to make use of gyro aim. It currently only works on mobile, as no other platform currently supports gyro built-in under Godot. In the future, it might feature another extension to make use of it for controllers, if I can find a good one. Eventually, this game should come to resemble a basic "aim trainer" with targets, timing, scoring, and a menu.

This project is more just me experimenting with programming various features I would like to use for future projects. If you want to use this as a basis for your own project, you're on your own.
